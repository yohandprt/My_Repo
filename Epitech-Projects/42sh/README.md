# 42sh

> "This isnâ€™t just running commands. This is taming the terminalâ€”with flair!"  

On this projet with the base of our `Minishell 2`, the goal is to recreat our shell base on the `TCSH`. By running multiple bult-in, that we are create.

## Features

- ðŸ”§ Built-in and external commands 
  - Run standard shell commands or your own built-ins:
  - Exemple: `ls`, `cat`, `cd`, `exit`, `setenv`, `unsetenv`
- ðŸ”— Command chaining
Combine commands with:
  - `;` - sequential execution
  Example: `cd src; ls`
  - `|` â€“ piping output between commands
  Examples: `cat file.txt | grep error`
  - `||` & `&&` â€“ conditional execution
  Examples: `make && ./42sh`, `gcc file.c || echo "Compile failed"`
- Use file redirections:
  - `>` - overwrite a file
  Example: `echo "Hello" > file.txt`
  - `>>` - append to a file
  Example: `echo "More" >> file.txt`
  - `<` â€“ read from a file
  Example: `sort < numbers.txt`
- ðŸ“œ Quoting and grouping
  - `'...'` â€“ literal strings
  - `"..."` â€“ interpolate variables
  - `(...)` â€“ group commands
  Example: (cd src && make)
- Error handling
Proper handling of invalid commands, syntax errors, and return codes.

## Installation

1. Compile the project:
    ```bash
    make
    ```
2. Run the shell:
    ```bash
    ./42sh
    ```

## Example Usage

```bash
$> ls -l ; echo "Build complete"
$> cat main.c | grep "int"
$> echo "Hello World" > hello.txt
$> ./42sh && echo "Shell started"
$> false || echo "Previous command failed"
```

## Why?
This project was created as part of the Epitech curriculum to understand how a shell works internally â€” from parsing input to handling system calls and process management.
