# Chocolatine

**Chocolatine** is a GitHub Actions workflow project designed to improve your development workflow by enforcing integration and testing best practices. Just like the delicious pastry itâ€™s named after, it helps you get through your day (and projects) more efficiently.

This project requires creating a reusable GitHub Actions workflow to automate checks such as coding style, compilation, testing, and repository mirroring.

## Project Goal

Create a GitHub Actions workflow named `chocolatine.yml` that can be reused across different Epitech projects.

The workflow must:

- Be fully self-contained (no external files required).
- Run only the allowed external actions.
- Avoid hardcoded sensitive data (use **secrets**).
- Run on each **push** and **pull request**, **except**:
  - If the branch name starts with `ga-ignore-`.
  - If the repository is the same as the mirror target.

## Setup

Place the `chocolatine.yml` file either:

- At the **root** of the repository, or
- In the `.github/workflows/` directory

### Environment Variables (workflow-level)

Define these variables at the top of your workflow file:

```yaml
env:
  MIRROR_URL: git@github.com:your-org/mirror-repo.git
  EXECUTABLES: "bin/my_program,tools/helper"
```
- `MIRROR_URL`: SSH URL of the mirror repo

- `EXECUTABLES`: Comma-separated list of expected compiled binaries

## Secrets

Use secrets to store sensitive data. Required:

- `GIT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: SSH private key used for mirroring

## Workflow Overview
### Trigger Conditions

**The workflow must run on**:

- `push`

- `pull_request`

**But not when**:

- The branch starts with `ga-ignore-`

- The repo is the same as the `MIRROR_URL` target

## Jobs
1. **check_coding_style**

- Uses: `ghcr.io/epitech/coding-style-checker:latest`

- Steps:

    - `check.sh $(pwd) $(pwd)`

    - Display all errors as annotations

    - Fails if any errors are detected

1. **check_program_compilation**

- Uses: `epitechcontent/epitest-docker`

- Steps:

    - Run `make` with a 2-minute timeout

    - Run `make clean`

    - Check all files listed in `EXECUTABLES`:

        - Must exist and be executable

        - Fail with annotation if missing

2. **run_tests**

- Uses: `epitechcontent/epitest-docker`

- Step:

    - Run `make tests_run` (2 minute timeout)

3. **push_to_mirror**

- Uses: `pixta-dev/repository-mirroring-action`

- Condition: **only on push**

- Uses the `GIT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` secret to authenticate
